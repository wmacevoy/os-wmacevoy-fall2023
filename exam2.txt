Exam 2

Memory
  Memory Structure
     Process Layout
     Q: What is the memory layout of a process?  Where is the kernel?
        Why can't the process access the kernel memory directly?
     Kernel Layout
     Segment Registers
     Q: What is the kind and purpose of common segment registers?
     Security Measures
     Q: What is the purpose of base address randomization?
     Memory Mapping Unit
     Q: What is crucial about the MMU for creating the idea of a process?
     Pages - You must have hardware specific acceleration for looking up virtual addresses
     as physical pages for the core active pages, otherwise you spend all your time looking
     stuff up.
     Q: Why is memory arranged in pages?
     Page Table
     Q: What is used to look up the physical address of a given virtual address
     when a cache miss happens?

  Cache
     Miss
     Q: Why is a cache miss so expensive?  Why isn't everything in cache?
     Activate
     Q: What activates a cache load?  Generally how does this happen?
     Attack
     Q: What can be done to mitigate a cache timing attack?
     Performance
     Q: Why do shared libraries boost performance from a cache point of view?

  Swap
     Virtual Memory
     Q: Swap writes pages of process data to a block device or filesystem.
        What are some security concerns about this?

  Error Correcting Ram
     Q: Why should servers use ECC ram?

  Shared Memory
      IPC
      Posix API
      Q: Give an application area where shared memory may be a good idea.

  Shared Libraries
    Q: Why do shared libraries improve system security?
  Fork vs VFork
    Q: When would vfork() vs fork() save a lot of memory resources?

Filesystems
  Block Devices
     Magnetic
     Q: Why does writing 0's to a block not "erase" a platter sector?
     A: The magnitization is continuous (not discrete) and so there is a partial
        memory of the previous states.  This is why secure erase programs do
        multiple passes.
     Solid State
     Q: What happens when you write to a solid state drive?
     Cloud

  Stability
     Journaling
     Checkpoints
     Raid (also performance)
     Q: What is the purpose of Journaling?
  Security
     Encryption
     Q: Why is encryption better than policies for security?
     ACLâ€™s
     Q: Why are ACL's important for implementing the principle of least privilidge?
  File Systems
     Principle: NTFS, APFS, ext4 (fat32/vfat32)
     Q: Why is fat32 / vfat32 a choice for cross-plaform file systems?
  Tree vs. Graph
     What is a reason recursive programs looking through filesystems may hang?
  Soft vs Hard Link
  API
Security
   Physical
   Q: Why should servers be in a server room?
   Encryption
   Q: Why should laptops be full disk encrypted?
   Policies
   Q: Why should there be a root recovery key (managed by admins) to 
      decrypt laptops from a sales team?

   Hash
   Q: What is a modern cryptographic hash?  What does it do?
   Symmetric Key Encryption
   Q: Why should you always prefer system libraries for encryption?
   Public/Secret Key Encryption
   Q: skip

   Authentication types
    Q: What are some "things you know" authifications?   "things you have" 
    "things you are" 
   Password Management
     Q: Why are required password change times bad for security?
   Access Control Lists
     Q: See filesystems.

   SUID
     Q: Why are suid program necessary?  Why are they dangerous?
   Secure coding and race conditions
     Q: What is a better way to write:
        if (allowed) {
            take-admin-action();
        }
 Better 
        try {
          take-admin-action();
        } catch (failures) {

        }
